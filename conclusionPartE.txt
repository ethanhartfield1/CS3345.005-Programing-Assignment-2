I tested 8 different arrays.
I had array sizes of 10, 100, 1000, and 10000
For each size, one array was almost sorted, and one array was randomly sorted
The quicksort algorithm performed exponentially better than mergesort on array sizes 100 and less
Once the array sizes became 1000 and more, mergesort started to outperform quicksort
Also, as the size of the array increases, the almost sorted array was much slower than the random array
This has to do with the almost sorted array being one of the worst cases, as there is a lot of wasted comparisions
In conclusion, if array sizes are less than 1000, use quicksort
Otherwise, use mergesort, as it is more consistient when the number of inputs increase
